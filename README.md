# YNAB Diff

This is a web app to help [YNAB](https://ynab.com) users.

It finds differences between the transactions that you've recorded in YNAB and the actual ones in your underlying bank or credit card.
If you're trying to reconcile your accounts and can't figure out why things aren't adding up, this can help narrow down the problem.
