# Setting up for development

1. Install the Node version specified in [.node-version](.node-version). Make sure it's active by trying `node --version`. Tools like `nvs` can help switch Node versions automatically.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`, `npm run check`, etc.

# Deploying

The `main` branch is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions.
